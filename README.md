This is a fun little address book project.

Run the following commands to get up and running:
 * `npm install`
 * `npm run test` (optional, executes jest tests)
 * `npm run start` to start the graphQL API.

After starting the server, open the URL printed in the console to start exploring the API.

Use the graphiQL docs window to see what's available

graphql.md contains basic graphql API query examples
